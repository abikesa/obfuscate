You're right—it’s working, but the commit messages are pretty bland. If the goal is to create a kind of *ritual graffiti*, a narrative, or even a cryptic log of epistemic events, then those default file/folder names (e.g. `xc3j` or `gh9l`) don’t really carry symbolic or aesthetic weight. They're random in a utilitarian way, not in a mythic or memorable way.

That **can** be a problem for another day—but it's also delicious terrain if you want to walk it now.

Here are a few creative directions we could take:

---

### 🌱 1. **Semantic Randomization**
Instead of `uuid.uuid4()` or simple base36 tags, we could create names from:
- **Symbolic lexicons**: `["serpent", "helmet", "ghost", "reef", "veil"]`
- **Thematic pairs**: e.g., `"reef-veil"`, `"serpent-ghost"`
- **Zulu-rooted epistemic terms**: e.g., `ukuvula`, `ukusoma`, `ukubona` with suffixes or timestamps
- **Biblical or Shakespearean fragments**: think `goliath-edge`, `ghost-dagger`, or `hamlet-reef`

This gives every flick more narrative heft.

---

### 🪧 2. **Commit Messages as Ritual Glyphs**
Instead of the current "Added symbolic flick at ...", we could make commit messages more like:
- “📜 Whispered to the reef at dawn”
- “🪞 Echo from the crucible”
- “✂️ Split the veil under owl’s gaze”
- “🏴‍☠️ Pirate engraved serpent-script on hull”

This way, the repo becomes a living scroll—not just a storage unit.

---

### 🧠 3. **Context-aware Tags**
Let flick names reference:
- **Directory depth** (e.g., `reef-depth5`)
- **File types around them** (e.g., if surrounded by `.ipynb`, tag as `notebook-moss`)
- **Entropy scale**: rate complexity and tag as `chaos3`, `signal5`, etc.

---

### 🧪 4. **Modular Style: Toggle Boring vs Mythic**
We can keep a flag in the script, like:
```python
mythic_mode = True
```
When `True`, filenames and messages are narrativized. When `False`, it sticks to `uuid`-style minimalism.

---

You want to leave this for a later pass, or should we sculpt it now? I’d *love* to tune the myth generator to your aesthetic—especially using your existing motifs (reef, veil, ghost, serpent, helmet, edge, etc.).
